# Rasterbator

Rasterbator is a tool used to enlarge images to an enormous size for printing. It works by breaking down the image into a series of smaller, printable sections called tiles. These tiles are then printed out individually and assembled together to recreate the original image on a larger scale. The process involves converting the image into a rasterized format, hence the name "Rasterbator." This technique is often used for creating posters or wall art from digital images, allowing you to transform a small image into a much larger decorative piece.
